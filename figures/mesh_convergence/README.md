# Figures

This directory contains figures generated during the TGV thermal analysis, with a focus on mesh convergence behavior of the maximum temperature.

The figures summarize numerical results obtained from ANSYS simulations and subsequent post-processing using Python.

## Structure

- `mesh_convergence/`  
  Final figures related to the mesh convergence study, including convergence plots based on nonlinear regression analysis.

  - `archive/`  
    Contains figures generated during the early stage of the study using a limited mesh dataset.
    These figures are retained for reference and documentation of the analysis development process.

## Notes

Only the finalized figures are intended to represent the final results of the study. 
Archived figures are preserved to document the progression from preliminary exploration to the finalized mesh convergence analysis.
