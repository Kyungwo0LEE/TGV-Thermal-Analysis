## Mesh Convergence Verification

A mesh size sweep was conducted to verify mesh independence.
The following figures show the convergence behavior of the maximum
temperature with mesh refinement.

### Mesh convergence of Tmax

**Figure 1.** Maximum temperature as a function of mesh size.
As the mesh is refined, the maximum temperature approaches a stable value, indicating mesh-independent thermal results.


### Relative change between successive mesh refinements

**Figure 2.** Relative change in maximum temperature between successive mesh refinements.
The relative difference decreases below 0.1% for sufficiently fine meshes, demonstrating convergence of the numerical solution.
