# Archived Mesh Convergence Scripts

This directory contains preliminary Python scripts used during the early stage of the mesh convergence study.

These scripts were developed based on a limited mesh dataset and were primarily used for initial exploration and visualization of mesh-dependent
trends in the maximum temperature.

## Notes

The scripts in this directory are retained for reference and documentation of the development process. 
They are not used in the finalized analysis.

The final mesh convergence analysis, based on an expanded dataset and nonlinear regression, is implemented in the main
`python/mesh_convergence/` directory.
